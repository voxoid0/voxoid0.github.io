<p>The votes are in from the <a href="../collecting-data-to-validate-the-problem">problem validation</a>: the problem is real! Actually I "cheated" a bit, by validating six different problems, to find the biggest need among them. Several of them actually have a lot of potential, but people seemed to especially relate to one of them in particular. (More on the specifics later...)</p>
<p>So now that we know the problem is real, it is time to test proposed solutions! But once again, before creating any of the solutions, I need to "get out of the building" once again to ask if my proposed solution is what people <em>need</em>, and if the messaging resonates with them.</p>
<h2>The Survey Drag</h2>
<p>So once again, the hunt is on to find people kind enough to spend 3 minutes or so filling out a little survey. Typically survey responses is about 2%-5% of the people that you contact! Fortunately I've been getting about a 12% response rate through LinkedIn. I'm needing at <em>least</em> 20 responses, which means I'll probably need to send about 170 messages! This type of thing takes <em>time</em>. But not as much time as building <em>n</em> different solutions before getting "lucky" enough to find one people want to pay for.</p>
<h2>The Temptation to <em>Build</em></h2>
<p>And <em>boy</em> has it been hard to not build stuff! I'm a creative builder at heart (like many of you probably), and have all kinds of ideas for <em>cool</em> things that would be <em>really fun</em> to build. ...Like the <a href="hello-lo-lo-anybody-there-ere-ere">large-scale VR</a> for example...<em>still</em> want to build that one. (When will I give myself a vacation?) I'm realizing much more now that I have startup advice and accountability through The Startup Collaborative, that building a business truly takes hard work and discipline. Not just on the things you <em>want</em> to do, but also all the things you find a big drag...like begging people to take surveys.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I'm on it.</p>
