I came home Friday from my last day at Farm Credit Services of America (as a sub-contractor), and was welcomed by my wife and kids congratulating me with home-drawn cards and a delicious cake for after supper. After the weekend I would be starting to work full-time from home for Percebe Music Inc., a start-up founded by myself and a piano professor friend of mine who came up with the product idea, and still teaches at the college I studied music at. A couple of weeks ago we received generous funding from an investor, who is an acquaintance of both of ours that we both greatly respect.</p>
<p>Farm Credit Services of America was truly a great place to work at -- the best work culture I've experienced, and with the nicest people, and significant talent among the developers (after all, the culture draws them). It's no wonder they're rated "#1 place to work in Omaha". Yet the opportunity for which I've been working for for a long time is here! Ironically (but perhaps not accidentally) my hard work on previous start-up projects did not directly create this opportunity; my partner is the one who contacted me about the idea, and I eagerly leaped to the risk, committing roughly 200 hours into building a prototype starting in mid September 2015, mostly utilizing very early morning hours before leaving to work. Was that a run-on sentence I don't know but it was pretty exciting anyway so keep reading now where was I...</p>
<p>So here we go, full-throttle, into the fog! ...Hoping there are no walls. But then of course ingenuity supplies a radar-vision device. Yes! Walls, I can see you now... OK too much analogy. Anyway, 40 hours a week I'll be developing the software, working first toward a couple of user-test versions, then a Minimum Viable Product (oh yes, <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> methodology indeed), then onto wherever our user's desires take us. Plenty of complex algorithms -- so fun! -- plenty of platforms, plenty of drive. Let's do this!</p>
<p>Updates to come. Thanks for your support through reading this bundle of words that makes plenty for today. And for that reason...I'm out.</p>
