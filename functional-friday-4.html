<p>It's...<em>Functional Friday!</em> :party-parrot:</p>
<p><em>Option, SelectMany, and why C#'s coming nullable reference type is totally <em>meh</em></em></p>
<p><code>null</code> has been called "the billion dollar mistake" (and many say that estimate is low) because of all of the bugs caused by unhandled <code>null</code> values. Is there an alternative for a variable that may or may not have a value? In a sense no, but what we <em>should</em> have been doing is always being <em>explicit</em> about whether a variable, field, functional return value, etc., is optional or not. If an expression must always have a value, it should not be nullable. However C# references can always be nullable! Same for Java and many other languages. We haven't been explicit. It's like having a piece of dynamically-typed languages mixed in with our static typing.</p>
<p>That's why many languages, functional in particular, <em>are</em> explicit, usually by providing a keyword or type (<code>option</code> in F#). An <code>option</code> in F#, Scala, and Java et al, can have either a value of None or Some(value). (Unfortunately for those particular languages listed, they still have to support <code>null</code> for backwards compatibility. But good practice avoids <code>null</code> completely. I've done it, and it pays!) So instead of:</p>
<p><code>Food FindFavoriteFood(int personId)</code></p>
<p>with the potential of a caller assuming everyone will have a favorite:</p>
<p><code>Console.WriteLine(FindFavoriteFood(123).Name)</code></p>
<p>we can use <code>option</code>, and in C# there are several libraries providing such a type. I use nuget package <code>Option</code> from https://github.com/nlkl/Optional:</p>
<p><code>Option&lt;Food&gt; FindFavoriteFood(int personId)</code></p>
<p>Now the caller must handle both the None and the Some case. We could use an if/else to check if a value is there, but the more functional way (as an expression rather than imperative) would be to use <em>pattern matching</em>, also emulated by that library with <code>Option</code>'s <code>Match</code> method:</p>
<p><code>Console.WriteLine(FindFavoriteFood(123).Match(
    some: food =&gt; food.Name,
    none: () =&gt; "I don't have a favorite"))</code></p>
<p>(Not C#'s pattern matching in this case, but still FP's pattern matching nonetheless.) Now, C#'s coming nullable reference type where you can turn on disallowing null on regular references, <em>kinda</em> solves the problem also. But here's what it's missing that other languages with <code>option</code> provide: <code>Option</code> is IEnumerable. It will have either 0 or 1 elements. That in combination with <code>SelectMany</code> allows some :</p>
<p><code>var allFavorites = allPersonIds.SelectMany(FindFavoriteFood))</code></p>
<p>Catch that? For anyone without a favorite, FindFavoriteFood returns an <code>Option</code> of case <code>None</code> which is an <code>IEnumerable</code> of length 0, whereas those with favorites will be a <code>Some</code> or <code>IEnumerable</code> of length 1, so stream them all together with <code>SelectMany</code> and you get all favorites.</p>
<p>These reasons are why my team at Farm Credit started using <code>Option</code> everywhere a value is optional!</p>
<p>Unfortunately C#'s coming non-nullable/nullable reference types doesn't provide enumeration. Meh.</p>
