<h3>Pre-Validate, Pre-Validate, Pre-Validate, Pre-Validate!</h3>
<p>In previous startup attempts (including Percebe Music's successful launch), I would spend about three months building an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> to put in front of potential users to find out if it's what they need and how to make it better -- to start the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Build-Measure-Learn">build-measure-learn loop</a>. But there is a dangerous assumption behind that: your idea is a <em>real problem</em>. It's an easy mistake to make. But you have to remember: you're just <em>one</em> person. So the first step in the proverbial "get out of the building!" is to <em>pre-validate</em> the hypothetical problem -- yes, remember it is <em>hypothetical</em> until and unless "survey says" it is real.</p>
<p>Thanks to pre-validation, I realized within just a few weeks that the idea I was moving forward with had too much friction of sorts, creating too much risk for failure -- well I could have taken it, and maybe succeeded, but I chose rather to take a lower-friction route, and higher odds of success! <em>So</em>, to be more specific, for a month or so I was persuing a concept to use large-scale VR or AR -- like the kind where you literally walk or run around in a 10,000 square-foot area, and visually, through the headset, you are doing so in the virtual environment -- for police officer training and/or firefighter training. What I found during pre-validation phase was:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is very hard, no, very <em>very</em> hard, to get in contact with firefighter and police training decision makers. Or, it was very hard for <em>me</em> to get in contact with them. Either way, there is some major friction. How would I present a solution to them, or even find out if it's something they'll actually pay for? (to sustain the business, not to become filthy rich, for you judgmental ones out there)</li>
<li>It is very <em>very</em> hard to get in contact with them</li>
<li>My understanding of the industry, even after a month of looking into it, was not full enough to navigate. I was driving through a blizzard.</li>
<li>Something else probably</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I turned to an industry I know <em>tons 'n' tons</em> about, that I have <em>easy</em> and <em>regular</em> access to: software development. Yes and, <em>even though</em> I have been programming for 25 years...OK professionally for 9, built numberous applications solo, and with a team, I <em>still</em> refuse to assume my hypothetical problem/solution is real. So for the past week I've been working very hard to get at least 20 (local) developers to take a survey. </p>
<h3>"Survey" Is a Dirty Word</h3>
<p>OK I don't actually know why I only get a 5% response on my survey requests, even though I hand-picked each individual local developer rather than mass-emailing, and wrote a personal e-mail explaining I was a local, fellow developer, and this tool would be to help <em>them</em>. But I imagine the word "survey" in the message almost directly triggering their right index finger to hit the delete button on the e-mail -- and I don't blame them. Who ever wants to take a survey? They're usually long, provide no benefit to you, and are there just to try to get you to buy something. </p>
<p>But I like the advice I've heard a number of times in the startup community: if you focus on <em>helping</em> people, and solving their problems, you will be successful. This is true, and also nice because even if you don't succeed as a growing business, at least you tried to help people.</p>
<p>I have 11 responses to the survey now, and need at the <em>bare minimum</em> 20 -- a number given by The Startup Collaborative, after all any less than that creates a sampling that could misrepresent the industry. Those 11 so far indicate we are on to something...to be continued...</p>
