</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Spring of 2015, a friend of mine who is a piano professor (not my business partner; a different friend) said his piano students need some more character pieces, and suggested I compose a set. Since I love composing and the idea of seeing my music used by others, I immediately thought it was a good idea. I had ideas for a number of pieces from the set, but as I seem to find very little time for composing, I ended up with only two so far. Here is the first: "Electromechanical".</p>

<p>Oh, and since I'm feeling extra philanthropic, here's the sheet music, for free! (/images/...pssst, that's your cue to cheer wildly.)</p>
