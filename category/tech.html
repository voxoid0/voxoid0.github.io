</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>My current project requires some complex software on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+, which has 1GB of RAM. For my technology stack's primary components, I've chosen Scala, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. Typically C++ or python is used with OpenCV or TensorFlow. However,</p>
<ol>
<li>C++ is low level, and I've been sorry one too many times for choosing it (I know there can be plenty of discussion there around e.g. C++14, but that's for another day).</li>
<li>I would need a significant refresher and update on the latest C++ language standards, boost libraries, and libraries for HTTP, high-level concurrency, etc.</li>
<li>While I've used Python, I'm no master of it, and while I could become one, I've already taken on way too many "masteries"; it's time to limit my learning in favor of more productivity, when within reason; there will always be plenty of learning to do on other fronts in technology and software development.</li>
<li>Python isn't the quickest slitherer among languages and platforms anyway, and yes slitherer is a real word, because I just used it. (...I don't actually agree with that philosophy, but sometimes we adopt a way of thinking for immediate convenience rather than truth, don't we? An oh-so-subconscious technique to be avoided in weightier matters.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Scala provides a high-level language and platform, concise code that can be quickly changed and maintained, and the benefits of both the functional and OO paradigms. (That's right, I'm not a functional purists, though I use OO almost solely for data objects and for organization of functions). And equally important, I'm already seasoned in its ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, especially in a large project, project risks must be mitigated <em>up front</em>, else you pay big ouchies later when you've already invested precious time and resources into a decision that won't work, or that turns out to be significantly more costly than an alternative. </p>
<p>This application will be using computer vision and machine learning, but potentially memory-intensive. So one of the first risks to shoot down is if a scala application, <em>with</em> its dependencies, would </p>
<p>scala app, no additional dependencies (21MB / 2.4% RAM, 5.6MB on disk): </p>
<p>scala app with dependencies (31MB / 3.4% RAM, 12.4MB on disk):</p>
<p>On my Windows desktop, the same scala app-with-no-dependencies used 862MB of RAM! That the scala app with large dependencies takes only 31MB of RAM is great news. 3.4% is a significant price, but worth the increased speed and ease of development with scala instead of C++. If I need to free up RAM e.g. for a large CNN, I can free it up other ways. Look at the other processes for example:</p>
<p>Xorg, the Raspbian/Debian/Linx X Windows gui process, takes 6%/54MB, so using command-line-only Linux gets rid of that. Using SSH instead of VNC during development would free up another 1.6%/11MB or so if necessary. That's about all we can eliminate from the processes though; that 30MB is very large compared to the other processes. But even with a C++ app, the majority of our application's RAM will be used by CNN(s) and image processing, both of which can be tweaked for memory usage. I don't see any need to sacrifice scala or JVM over memory usage.</p>
<p>The dependencies I added were:
scala-library:2.11.8
akka-actor
slf4j-api, slf4j-log4j
commons-io
commons-codec
xstream
joda-time
com.google.code.gson
org.apache.httpcomponents: 4.1</p>                </article>
