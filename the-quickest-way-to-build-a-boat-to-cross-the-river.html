The quickest way to build a boat to cross the river, is to cross the river without building a boat.</p>
<p>Sometimes we get so caught up in building the boat that we forget to check if there's a way to cross the river without it. And if there is (and more often than we think, there is), we can save oodles of time, resources, and work. <em>And</em>, being on the other side so much sooner, we can do many more things, and things more worthwhile.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, suppose you wish to write a program that takes two images as input, finds similar parts of objects, and circles those common features on each image. You set out to sketch how such a program would work, formulate algorithms, start building prototypes. Or, you could do a little "Googling" to find that this is a well-know problem called <em>feature matching</em>, and is already solved by the commercial-friendly, open-source <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV library</a>.</p>
